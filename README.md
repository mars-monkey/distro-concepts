# My Distro Concepts

This is my repository to share a couple of my visions for distros in the future. I have three concepts here: a practical concept, a JovarkOS specific concept, and a theoretical concept. My practical concept takes the best software and packages it into a great out of the box experience. The JovarkOS concept is a modified version that caters to the choices that the team and community have made. My theoretical concept includes a bunch of software that has not been written because I am not completely satisfied with the existing options. I will update these concepts with more specifics as I learn more about Linux and programming and I hope that I will be able to use them to make a distro in the future.

At the moment I'm helping out with the [JovarkOS](https://jovarkos.org) project. I would love for them to take a look at my JovarkOS concept and see if they want to incorporate some of my ideas in it.

Part of the reason I am working with the Jovark team is learning programming and on-the-ground team skills in order to realize this concept in the long term.
