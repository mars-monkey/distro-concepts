# My Distro Concepts

These are two concepts of distros I hope to build in the future.

### Practical Concept
My practical concept takes the best pre-existing software and packages it into a great out-of-box experience.

### Theoretical concept
My theoretical concept includes a bunch of software that has not been written because I am not completely satisfied with the existing options.

I will update these concepts with more specifics as I learn more about Linux and programming and I hope that I will be able to use them to make a distro in the future.
