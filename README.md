# My Distro Concepts

This is my repository to share a couple of my visions for distros in the future. I have three concepts here:

### Practical Concept
My practical concept takes the best software and packages it into a great out of the box experience.

### Theoretical concept
My theoretical concept includes a bunch of software that has not been written because I am not completely satisfied with the existing options. I will update these concepts with more specifics as I learn more about Linux and programming and I hope that I will be able to use them to make a distro in the future.
