# My Distro Concept

This is my concept for a great all-round distro with smart defaults, good performance, great stability, and cutting edge software that especially caters to those with less technical knowledge. I will update it with more specifics as I learn more about Linux and programming and Lord willing I will eventually be able to make it a reality.

At the moment I'm helping out with the [[JovarkOS]](https://jovarkos.org) project. I think that their goals of being stable, usable, and performant would be fulfilled if they followed my little idea, but I don't expect them to copy it verbatim, but I would love it if they took some of the ideas from this for the development of their distro. :)

Part of the reason I am working with the Jovark team is learning programming and on-the-ground team skills in order to realize this concept in the long term.
